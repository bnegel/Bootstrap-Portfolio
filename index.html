                            <p>Barbara is a teacher, writer, editor, and consultant who is happiest bridging the worlds of business, technology, and arts/humanities. She has published a number of children's books as well as poetry in various journals including Northeast Corridor and Lavender Review. She is the book reviewer for Light, an online journal of light verse, and her stage adaptation of Virginia Woolf's short story, "'Slater's Pins Have No Points'" will be published later this year in Katherine Mansfield Studies.

                                In her business life, Barbara has been a qualitative consumer researcher specializing in sensitive topics, a marketing and web copywriter, and a business presentation trainer and coach. Oh, and for fun, she teaches English at Harold Washington College.
                                
                                Barbara has a BA in comparative literature from the University of Illinois and an MALit from Northwestern University, with concentrations in performance studies, early modern literature, and modernism. She is currently a student in Northwestern's full-stack Coding Boot Camp. She wants to be able to apply this learning to a job that links her consumer research and writing skills with her (eventual) understanding of web functionality. She also hopes to offer her skills to the world of digital humanities.
                                
                                She lives in Chicago with a wonderful wife, a large, goofy dog, and a few hundred books.</p>
